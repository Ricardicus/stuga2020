I've tried to minimize the changes to the original file (stuga.bas) as downloaded
from the autho, Kimmo Eriksson's homepage (www.kimmoeriksson.se). All changes
are documented here:

Character Encoding
------------------

The original seem to be encoded in ISO-646-SE. This means that swedish
characters are displayed as "{", "}", "\", "]", etc when opened as UTF-8.
This can easily be converted using iconv:

```
iconv -f iso-646-se -t utf-8 stuga.bas
```

But the problem is that some of these characters are used in the BASIC
syntax, for example to separate statements on one line

```
10 PRINT "Hello" \ PRINT "World"
```

Just translating that using iconv would result in this string, which
is not legal BASIC:

```
10 PRINT "Hello" Ã– PRINT "World"
```

I found no other solution than to semi-manually replace all swedish
characters in strings and comments. The file was then saved as UTF-8.
